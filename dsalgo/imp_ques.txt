1.How to initialize 2D vector?
	vector< vector<int> > matrix(n, vector<int> (m, 0));
2.How to cast int to long long?
	suppose int a = 10;
		long long b = 20;
		long long ans = b + (long long)a;
3.How to pass 2D matrix as argument in C++ function?
4.How to pass 2D vector (does it needs pass by reference)?
5.How to do AND in C++?
	int a = 5, b = 6; int c = a & b;//correct way 
	//(a && b) is a wrong way to get AND
6.How to calculate power(2, n)?
	1 << n
